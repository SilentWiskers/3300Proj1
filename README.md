# Getting Started - Accessing Lab 

Everything needs to be done at the lab machines. There are 5 labs, lab1 - lab5. The code you write needs to compile in those machines. 
To access those machines, follow the following instructions:

# For Windows user
1. Download and install Putty 
   
   a. If you are inside campus, connect to `lab1.cs.clemson.edu`
   
   b. When prompted enter your clemson username (corresponds to your email) and password
   
2. If you are outside campus, connect to `access.computing.clemson.edu`
   a. When prompted enter your clemson username (corresponds to your email) and password
  
   b. Now once you are inside campus network, ssh into lab machines using: `ssh myusername@lab1.cs.clemson.edu`
  
   c. You might be prompted to enter username and password again
  
   d. You are now inside lab1 machine terminal

# For Linux  User
1. If you are inside campus, ssh into “lab1.cs.clemson.edu” using  `ssh myusername@lab1.cs.clemson.edu`
   
   a. When prompted enter your clemson username (corresponds to your email) and password
   
   b. You are now inside lab1 machine terminal
